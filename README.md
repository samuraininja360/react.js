### The Shroud Ninja's React Template

Welcome to a basic React App template for Material UI and other npm packages! The App auto-updates content and adds more potential to your website.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started on Repl.it
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](https://github.com/samuraininja360/react.js/blob/main/src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Repl.it runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
